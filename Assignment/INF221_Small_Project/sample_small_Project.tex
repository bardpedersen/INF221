\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In this section, provide a brief introduction to the term paper's
topic and give an overview of the material that follows.


\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

In this section, you shall described how you performed the
benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item What test-data did you use and how was it generated?
\item How did you execute your benchmarks?
\item How did you measure runtimes?
\item What kind of computer did you use, and what software versions?
\item Provide git hashes of all relevant files!
\item This section should be divided into several subsections.
\end{itemize}

  \label{lst:bench_setup}
  \begin{lstlisting}
times = []
for k in range(1, 5):
   n = 2**k
   times.append(bench(func, n))
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}

\begin{table}
  % Table captions always come *above* the table.

  \label{tab:hashes}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \hline
    Algorithm & Best case  & Average case & Worst case\\\hline
    xxxxx & xxxxx& xxxxx & xxxxx  \\
    xxxxx& xxxxx & xxxxx & xxxxx \\\hline
  \end{tabular}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{sample_plot}
  % figure captions below figure
  \caption{Benchmark results for \dots.}
  \label{fig:bench}
\end{figure}

Here, you should present your results. Provide 1-3 figures with tidy
lettering in legible font sizes. Figures should not be resized when
included, so prepare them for the column width of 84~mm. For good
quality, export figures as PDF files from Python.

The results section should be divided into several subsections.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

In this section, you should summarize your results and compare them to
expectations from theory in the lectures.
